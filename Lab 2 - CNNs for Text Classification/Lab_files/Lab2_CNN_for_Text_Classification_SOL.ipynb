    "\n",
    "A very simple example of CNN architecture for text classification can be found [here](https://keras.io/examples/imdb_cnn/). Take a look in order to have an idea about how things should look like at this level.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few other simple implementations: https://www.kaggle.com/jacklinggu/keras-mlp-cnn-test-for-text-classification/notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that if the dataset is too small and the complexity of the model is large, then the phenomenon of overfitting will be imminent and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will look similar to what you have seen in the CNN for image classification (the first lab):\n",
    "\n",
    "> **3.1.** Instantiate the model. Use the constructor of the Sequential class as you have done in the first laboratory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **3.2.** After creating the initial model, we need to populate it with the hidden layers:\n",
    "- **3.2.1.** With text classification, the first layer is usually an **embedding layer** in which word indices that come from the input layer are converted to word vectors (word2vec). This is an important conversion which enables a more efficient and faster processing of textual data. Each word integer is mapped into a one dimensional vector of floats which captures its syntactical properties within the movie reviews text corpus. This subject may be covered in a little more depth in an upcoming laboratory. At the moment, a few insights have been introduced in the theoretical support for this lab and even more explanation can be found in the Tensorflow and Google code archives and other blogs:\n",
    "  - https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec\n",
    "  - https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec\n",
    "  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8tQZChniMk&list=PLR2RxXcwFe533vpJhgiDOAONyRzj3lzbJ\n",
    "  - http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations\n",
    "- **3.2.2.** After the embedding layer, add a **dropout** layer with a probability of 0.4.\n",
    "- **3.2.3.** Add a **CONV** layer with 128 filters, filter size 3, padding same, activation relu and stride 1. Since our word vectors are one dimensional, we only need 1-dim convolutions. Keras provides us with a built in method for doing it elegantly. Note that we need to specify a convolution kernel length and number of filters to use (nb_filter). More info about parameters and usage at: https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/\n",
    "- **3.2.4.** Use **Max Pooling** after the CONV layer.\n",
    "- **3.2.5.** Add another **CONV** layer, similar in terms of parameters with what we have at 3.2.3. The only difference is that here we are trying a different kernel size (5 to be more specific).\n",
    "- **3.2.6.** Add a **Batch Normalization** layer. You can, of course, try to train the model without this layer, or with any other modification. Without this layer in particular, you are going to (probably) see a fair amount of overfitting.\n",
    "- **3.2.7.** Use **Max Pooling** again.\n",
    "- **3.2.8.** Add a Flatten layer.\n",
    "- **3.2.9.** Add a dense layer with hidden_dims hidden units and activation relu.\n",
    "- **3.2.10. Dropout** neurons with a probability of 0.5. Do this in order to add even more prvention of overfitting.\n",
    "- **3.2.11.** Our output layer consists of one neuron. The sigmoid activation will produce a float number between 0 and 1. We can round it to 0 or 1 to conclude if the movie review is negative or positive, or we can interpret it as a fuzzy value of how much the review is positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **3.3.** Compile the model using binary crossentropy as loss, accuracy as metric and adam optimizer. These values for the parameters should be seen as a suggestion and you are more than welcome to use any other valid values and see how the behavior changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **3.4.** Train (fit) the model on the training data, with the test set as validation data. Set shuffle to True. For this particular dataset,  one possible (decent) batch size is 64 and (maybe) 10 epochs should be enough in order to dive into the problem."
